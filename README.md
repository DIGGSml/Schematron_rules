# DIGGS Schematron Rules

DIGGS (Data Interchange for Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Specialists) Schematron rules are essential for validating XML files against specific business rules, ensuring data quality and compliance with DIGGS standards. This repository provides a central location for managing, improving, and contributing to DIGGS Schematron rules.

## What is Schematron?

Schematron is a rule-based XML schema language used to validate the content and structure of XML documents. Unlike other XML schema languages (e.g., XSD or DTD), Schematron enables complex validations beyond simple structural checks. It uses XPath expressions to enforce rules and provides detailed error messages when an XML document does not meet the expected criteria.

In the context of DIGGS, Schematron rules ensure that XML files:
- Contain all required elements.
- Have valid and consistent data values.
- Conform to logical relationships across the document.

## DIGGS Schematron Rules Spreadsheet

The [DIGGS Schematron Rules Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qGPapQf673u-REtkadHVOuQRmwuqQpROEG9YeifMG-c/edit?usp=sharing) is a collaborative resource for managing and developing rules. It includes:
- A list of existing rules with descriptions.
- Details about their associated XPath expressions.
- The ability for users to propose new rules or suggest improvements.

### How to Access and Contribute to the Spreadsheet

1. Visit the [DIGGS Schematron Rules Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qGPapQf673u-REtkadHVOuQRmwuqQpROEG9YeifMG-c/edit?usp=sharing).
2. Review existing rules and their descriptions.
3. To propose a new rule:
   - Add your **rule description**, **XPath expression**, and **error message** in the appropriate section.
   - Notify the maintainers via the contact methods listed below or by commenting directly in the spreadsheet.
4. Maintain an open dialogue with the community to ensure the rules meet industry needs.

## Validating DIGGS Files

Users can validate their DIGGS XML files against Schematron rules using our web-based tool:
- **Validation URL**: [DIGGS Schematron Validator](https://8508-01jhpd4e7p5cndqdmth8sma55m.cloudspaces.litng.ai)

### Steps to Validate
1. Upload your DIGGS XML file at the validation URL.
2. The tool will automatically check your file against the Schematron rules.
3. Review the results for any errors or warnings and take corrective actions as needed.

## Why Contribute?

Your contributions to the DIGGS Schematron rules ensure:
- Higher data quality across the geotechnical and geoenvironmental industry.
- Compliance with evolving industry standards.
- A stronger and more adaptable DIGGS standard for all users.
